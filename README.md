## Description

A single-page application (SPA) for managing IT support tickets.

Allows users to view, create, edit, and delete support tickets, and view detailed information including comments.

## Key Features

- View all tickets in a list.

- View detailed information for a single ticket.

- Create new tickets with form validation.

- Edit existing tickets.

- Delete tickets.

- Add comments to tickets.

- Dynamic status and priority styling.

- Responsive design (if you make it responsive!).

- Client-side routing.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: Angular, TypeScript, HTML, CSS.
- Libraries: RxJS (for Observables).
- Dev Tools: Angular CLI.

## What I Learned/Challenges Overcome:

- Gained hands-on experience with Angular's standalone components.

- Implemented robust client-side routing with route parameters.

- Managed application state using RxJS Observables.

- Practiced dependency injection for services.

- Debugged common Angular compilation and rendering issues (e.g., AOT vs JIT, component bootstrapping).

- Improved UI/UX with CSS styling for navigation and component layout.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
